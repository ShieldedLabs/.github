**Shielded Labs** is an independent, donation-funded Zcash support organization
based in Switzerland. It is the first organization in the Zcash ecosystem
that has never received direct or indirect funding from the Development
Fund or block rewards.

Our mission is to build unstoppable private money that empowers human
freedom and self-sovereignty. We focus on projects that advance the
sustainability, security, and scalability of the Zcash network.
