Our mission is to build unstoppable private money that empowers human freedom and self-sovereignty. We focus on projects that advance the sustainability, security, and scalability of the Zcash network.

## Our Initiatives

2. The step-function ZEC issuance is smoothed to a curve. This enableds more predictable miner rewards, and a much more simplified implementation.

Each change is defined as a Zcash Improvement Proposals (ZIP):
-  ZIP-233: [Burning](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0233)
-  ZIP-234: [Smoothing the Issuance Curve](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0234)
